# Key Logger

This is a simple key logger built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to track key presses and releases in real-time.

## Features

- Start and stop key logging using buttons.
- Display the current key state (pressed or released).
- Simple and interactive UI.

## Files

- `index.html` - The main HTML file containing the structure and styling of the key logger.
- `index.js` - The JavaScript file handling key press and release events.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click the "Start Logging" button to begin tracking key presses.
3. Press any key on the keyboard to see the log updates.
4. Click the "End Logging" button to stop tracking.

## How It Works

- Event listeners for `keydown` and `keyup` are added when logging starts.
- Pressed key details are displayed in the UI.
- Logging can be stopped at any time, clearing the display.
